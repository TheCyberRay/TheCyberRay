WELCOME TO MY GITHUB

I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst with a background in Software Engineering, passionate about securing digital environments. I specialize in security operations, network security, penetration testing, and encryption, leveraging tools like Kali Linux, Splunk, Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite to identify and mitigate threats.

With certifications from ISC2, Google, Cisco, IBM, and Justfine Infotech, I make sure to stay up-to-date in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. As a former cybersecurity instructor, I have a knack for breaking down complex security concepts into actionable insights.

Beyond cybersecurity, I’m skilled in SEO content writing and front-end web development, optimizing digital presence using WordPress and content strategies. Fluent in English and conversational in French, I communicate technical findings effectively across diverse teams.

Let’s connect! I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and making digital spaces more secure.
