## WELCOME TO MY GITHUB

I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst with a Software Engineering background, specializing in security operations, penetration testing, network security and encryption. Certified by ISC2, Google, Cisco, and IBM, I stay up to date in industry trends. With expertise in tools like Kali Linux, Splunk, Burpsuite, Nmap, Metasploit etc. I identify and mitigate threats. As a former cybersecurity instructor, I simplify complex security concepts, and I also excel in SEO writing and front-end development (Wordpress). Fluent in English and conversational in French, I communicate security insights effectively.


## OBJECTIVE
My journey in **cybersecurity** has led me to develop deep expertise in **penetration testing, network security, and encryption**. I am eager to contribute my skills in a **Security Operations Center (SOC) or Red Team environment** as a **Cybersecurity Analyst**.
